The Portugal international did not look happy and walked straight down the tunnel.But the substitution was to pay off when Dybala collected the ball from Gonzalo Higuain, dribbled his way into the area and fired into the bottom left corner.AC Milan slip to 14th, just four points off the relegation zone. La Liga: Morata rescues Atletico Atletico Madrid were heading for another disappointment on Sunday before Alvaro Morata came to his side's rescue again.The striker provided the spark Atletico needed after his team fell behind against Espanyol thanks to Sergi Darder's long-range effort, which increased the pressure on Atletico following their three-match winless run and victories by Spanish league leaders Barcelona and Real Madrid on Saturday.Morata led Atletico's rally with an assist to Angel Correa's goal just before half-time. He then scored his sixth goal in as many matches after the break to put the team back on top before Koke sealed the 3-1 victory in injury time.The home win moved Atletico to third place with 24 points, one point behind Barcelona and Madrid, who both have a game in hand.La Liga fixturesLa Liga tableSevilla also kept the pressure up at the top by beating Real Betis 2-1 in the Seville derby.Lucas Ocampos and Luuk de Jong scored for the visitors, while Betis got on the board through Loren Morn.It was Sevilla's first win after two consecutive league draws.

The 54-year-old Streich, standing in his technical area, was knocked onto his back after Abraham caught him with his shoulder as he ran off the pitch in pursuit of the ball.Abraham was subsequently sent off despite remonstrating with the referee, as was Freiburg midfielder Vincenzo Grifo - who had earlier been substituted - for his role in the ugly touchline fracas.That took the number of red cards in the match to three, with Frankfurt having also lost Gelson Fernandes on the stroke of half-time to a second booking.The only goal of the game was scored by Nils Petersen in the 77th minute, the Germany striker drilling home a first-time finish for his fourth goal in his last three league matches.Bundesliga tableBundesliga fixturesPetersen's goal saw Freiburg move level in second with Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig, who both won on Saturday, but Monchengladbach remained four points clear with their 3-1 victory over Bremen.Two goals in quick succession from Ramy Bensebaini and Patrick Herrmann midway through the first half set Monchengladbach on course.Herrmann's second just before the hour mark made it 3-0 and although the hosts saw Bensebaini sent off and Leonardo Bittencourt pull a goal back for Bremen late on, Marco Rose's men had done enough.Also on Sunday, Bayer Leverkusen beat Wolfsburg 2-0 to pick up their first Bundesliga win in five matches and climb up to eighth.Karim Bellarabi gave Leverkusen a 25th-minute lead and Paulinho settled the contest late on as Wolfsburg suffered a fourth successive defeat in all competitions.Ligue 1: Payet double inspires Marseille Dimitri Payet scored twice as Marseille won 2-1 against Lyon in Ligue 1 despite the second-half dismissal of Alvaro Gonzalez.Payet put Marseille two goals to the good at half-time, first with a penalty and then a clinical finish as he was involved three times in a rapid counter-attack.The second half saw a delay of around five minutes as thick fog descended on the Stade Velodrome but Moussa Dembele pulled one back after an error from Gonzalez, who was then shown a straight red card for a professional foul on the ex-Celtic striker.But the 10 men held on as Martin Terrier's effort in the 90th minute flashed millimetres wide and Jason Denayer's header was easily saved.Ligue 1 fixturesLigue 1 tableSt Etienne climbed to fourth place with a 3-2 win at Nantes.The hosts led twice, through Ludovic Blas and Imran Louza, but Miguel Trauco equalised on the first occasion and Denis Bouanga's brace secured victory for Claude Puel's side.Montpellier are sixth after an emphatic 3-0 win over Toulouse.Andy Delort's sublime chip was disallowed for offside but he neatly created Gaetan Laborde's eventual opener just before half-time and victory was secured in the second half by Damien Le Tallec's header and Teji Savanier's long-range strike.Rennes came from behind to beat Amiens in the day's other game.Sehrou Guirassy gave the visitors the lead after Gael Kakuta's clever flick but Adrien Hunou quickly bundled home an equaliser.M'Baye Niang's close-range finish and Raphinha's penalty, awarded by VAR, settled the match in the second half.

Two goals from the seemingly unstoppable Robert Lewandowski helped Bayern Munich banish the nightmare of last week's thrashing by Eintracht Frankfurt that led to the sacking of Niko Kovac. Six days after Bayern's heaviest Bundesliga defeat for over 10 years in losing 5-1 to Eintracht, they hammered old rivals Borussia Dortmund 4-0 at the Allianz Arena to move up to third and a point behind leaders Borussia Monchengladbach.Poland striker Lewandowski scored the first and third goals in the 17th and 76th minutes to take his tally to a remarkable 26 in 22 games for club and country this season.Serge Gnabry added a VAR-confirmed second just after the break, with a Mats Hummels own goal 10 minutes from time compounding Dortmund's misery.Wenger: I'll hold Bayern talks next weekPSG boss Tuchel contacted by BayernSchweinsteiger: Jose would be tempted by BayernLeipzig stay in touchSecond-placed RB Leipzig are also a point behind Monchengladbach following a come-from-behind 4-2 win at Hertha Berlin.They were made to do it the hard way at the Olympiastadion, however, as the home side opened the scoring with a stunning strike from Maxi Mittelstadt just after the half hour.Hertha's lead was shortlived, though, as six minutes later Timo Werner slotted home the equaliser from the penalty spot after VAR confirmed a handball against Karim Rekik, with Marcel Sabitzer giving the visitors the lead on the stroke of half-time.Leipzig had to wait until late on to seal the points via goals from Kevin Kampl and Werner's 11th of the season, with Davie Selke's added-time strike nothing more than a consolation.Bundesliga tableBundesliga fixturesBundesliga round-up: Wins for Union Berlin, AugsburgUnion Berlin almost threw away a three-goal lead as they held on to beat Mainz 3-2 at the Coface Arena.Daniel Brosinski's own goal on the half hour sparked Mainz's downfall, that was completed by a double either side of the interval from Sebastian Andersson to take the Sweden international's tally for the season to six.Karim Onisiwo pulled one back in the 81st minute, with Brosinksi adding a second in the fourth minute of added time, only for Union to claim a third victory in their last four league games to lift themselves up to mid-table.Rouwen Hennings scored a 23-minute second-half hat-trick as Fortuna Dusseldorf came from behind on three occasions to salvage a point from a 3-3 draw at Schalke, who missed the chance to move into the top four.Goals from Daniel Caligiuri, Ozan Kabak and Suat Serdar all gave Schalke the lead at various stages, only for Hennings to equalise every time, with his first from the spot, and his hat-trick goal coming five minutes from time for his 11th of the season.SC Paderborn remain rooted to the foot of the table after suffering a ninth league defeat of the campaign, with Philipp Max scoring the only goal of the game in Augsburg's 1-0 win at the Benteler-Arena.La Liga: Real keep pace at top Real Madrid hammered Eibar 4-0 to keep the pressure on at the top of La Liga.The visitors - aiming to move ahead of Real Sociedad and keep pace with Barcelona, who beat Celta Vigo 4-1, hit three goals inside the first 30 minutes.

Zinedine Zidane says he will continue to state that it would be a \"dream\" for Kylian Mbappe to seal a move to Real Madrid, despite criticism of his comments from Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Leonardo.  The World Cup winner has been linked with a move to the Bernabeu and admitted during the summer transfer window that he would be open to a \"new project\", before agreeing to stay at PSG for the 2019/20 term.Earlier this week, PSG sporting director Leonardo labelled Zidane's comments on Mbappe potentially moving to La Liga as ''annoying'' and ''irritating\".'Mbappe will leave PSG for Real Madrid'CL round-up: Real Madrid hit sixPSG boss Tuchel contacted by Bayern\"All I said was something the player had already said, that it was his dream to wear Real Madrid's white jersey,\" Zidane said.\"That's all I said, and I'm saying it again, and I will repeat it everyday.\"Regarding Leonardo's reaction I have no comments. He says whatever he wants, he's entitled to, just like I'm entitled to say whatever I want today.\" Mbappe played 83 minutes of PSG's 1-0 victory over Club Brugge in midweek to help maintain their 100 per cent record in Group A of the Champions League.Liverpool have also been rumoured to be interested in the striker in recent weeks, but prior to the Reds' clash with Manchester City, Jurgen Klopp denied the links, stating that last season's European Cup winners had \"absolutely no chance\" of signing him.Mbappe is under contract at Ligue 1 champions PSG until 2022 and has scored nine goals in 11 appearances in all competitions this term.The France international arrived at the club in 2018 in a &#163;121.5m transfer from Monaco after an initial season-long loan.
Jurgen Klopp says he is convinced Liverpool no longer have an issue convincing players to join the club - but admits they have no chance of signing Kylian Mbappe. Speculation in recent weeks has linked Liverpool with a move for the PSG forward, fuelled by the fact their new kit supplier Nike also have a deal with Mbappe.But when asked about signing the 20-year-old, Klopp said: \"Buying this calibre of player is difficult. I don't see any club at the moment who can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG.\"I don't see any club; that is how it is. And we are involved in the clubs that cannot do it. It is as easy as that.\"OK, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign him. What a player he is.\"But it is about the money, of course. No chance. Absolutely no chance. Sorry for killing that story!\"While he does not believe they can afford Mbappe, Klopp thinks Liverpool's improvement in recent seasons has increased their chances of signing the best players. They won the Champions League last season and recorded their largest ever points tally in the Premier League.They are six points clear in the league after winning 10 of their 11 games this campaign, and Klopp said: \"I don't think we struggle with convincing players. \"When you speak to a player, you can feel it, this year, last year, even three years ago, you can see in the eyes of a player; I am not sure if honour is the right word, but that it is good that we speak to them.\"The club is in a very good position. Image-wise, it maybe always was but now I think it is easier to live the life of a Liverpool supporter and that means automatically being in a situation to sign the players you want to sign.\"

Paris Saint-Germain head coach Thomas Tuchel has been contacted by Bayern Munich over the vacant manager's position at the Allianz Arena, according to <em>Sky in Germany</em>. An enquiry has been made about his availability both now and next summer but the French club say Tuchel will remain at PSG for the remainder of the 2019/20 campaign, and that the prospect of him leaving after this season will depend on their form.Bayern are searching for a replacement for Niko Kovac, who departed with Bayern fourth in the Bundesliga, having just been thrashed 5-1 by Eintracht Frankfurt.Tuchel, who was appointed at the Parc des Princes in 2018, guided PSG to the Ligue 1 title last season and has won two French Super Cups during his time in charge.He remains under contract at the French club until 2021.Ajax boss Erik ten Hag has been identified as another target for the role but said on Monday that he will not be leaving the Eredivisie champions before the end of the season.Meanwhile, former Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger believes Jose Mourinho \"would be tempted\" by the vacant position at the German club.
Real Sociedad went level on points with La Liga leaders Barcelona after snatching a 2-1 victory away to fellow high-flyers Granada on Sunday thanks to a late strike from forward Cristian Portu. Portu had given the Basque side the lead midway through the first half, latching on to a pass from Mikel Oyarzabal and confidently finishing into the bottom corner after Granada lost possession inside their own half.Promoted Granada had fallen off the summit of the table in midweek after surprisingly leading the standings last weekend and had the chance to reclaim top spot after Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid had all failed to win on Saturday.They drew level in the 36th minute with an audacious long-range free-kick from Alvaro Vadillo, helped by some poor goalkeeping from Sociedad's Alex Remiro.But it was the visitors who struck in the 89th minute to steal all the points, as substitute Adnan Januzaj picked out Porto with a ground pass and the striker again showed real composure inside the area to score his second goal of the game.La Liga fixturesLa Liga tableThe victory took Real Sociedad third on the standings on 22 points after 12 games, level with second-placed Real Madrid and leaders Barcelona, who both have a game in hand.Elsewhere, Eibar also picked up a late 2-1 win against Leganes, while in a topsy-turvy game that saw three converted penalties, Osasuna beat Alaves 4-2.Getafe beat Celta Vigo 1-0 while Real Valladolid cruised to a 3-0 win against Real Mallorca. Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao played out a goalless draw.Serie A: Balotelli faces racismMario Balotelli's most important kick on Sunday had nothing to do with the curling shot that he whipped into the top corner of the goal from beyond the box.Rather, it was the drop-kick the Brescia striker made moments earlier when he booted a ball high into the stands to express his frustration at racist chants from Hellas Verona fans.Balotelli then attempted to leave the field in the most high-profile incident yet in a Serie A season that has been marred by constant episodes of discrimination.Verona went ahead 2-0 before Balotelli scored for Brescia and the game ended 2-1.Lazio recorded their first away win against AC Milan in Serie A for 30 years to move fourth with a 2-1 victory at the San Siro.Ciro Immobile headed in his 100th goal for the capital club in the first half but the home side were soon level through a Bastos own goal.Serie A fixturesSerie A tableJoaquin Correa sealed the three points for Lazio with six minutes remaining to extend their unbeaten league run to six matches and move into the Champions League places.Quietly putting together a season that could be one to remember, Cagliari also moved into contention for the Champions League spots with a 2-0 win at 10-man Atalanta.An own-goal from Mario Pasalic and a goal from Christian Oliva moved Cagliari level on points with fourth-place Atalanta.Cagliari have not qualified for European competition in a quarter of a century since reaching the semi-finals of the 1994 UEFA Cup the competition which has since been renamed the Europa League.Elsewhere, Udinese won 3-1 at Genoa under interim coach Luca Gatti, who took over when Igor Tudor was fired Friday after the northeastern club conceded 11 goals in its previous two games.Lecce and Sassuolo drew 2-2 while Fiorentina were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Parma.Bundesliga: Schalke comeback beats Augsburg Schalke's Amine Harit scored an 82nd-minute winner as his team twice came from a goal down to beat hosts Augsburg 3-2 in the Bundesliga on Sunday and move level on points with fourth-placed Bayern Munich.Augsburg managed to score twice in the first half, once with captain Daniel Baier to take the lead in the 38th minute and another with Stephan Lichtsteiner's glancing header for an own goal on the stroke of half-time that brought Schalke level.Bayern part ways with KovacBundesliga fixturesBundesliga tableAlfred Finnbogason's well-taken penalty, awarded for a handball, put the hosts again in front on the hour but Schalke once more responded with Ozan Kabak's darting header from a Daniel Caligiuri free-kick 11 minutes later before Harit snatched the late winner.Elsewhere, Fortuna Dusseldorf beat Cologne 2-0 with Rouwen Hennings and Erik Thommy scoring.Ligue 1: Pressure eased on Vieira The pressure was growing on Nice coach Patrick Vieira after six matches without a win, so a 2-0 home victory in the French league against Reims on Sunday was timely.They were helped when visiting midfielder Moussa Doumbia was sent off in the 26th minute.

Inter were held to a 2-2 draw by Parma at San Siro, with Antonio Candreva's opener cancelled out by goals from former Inter forward Yann Karamoh and Gervinho to give the visitors a shock half-time lead.Serie A tableSerie A fixturesAntonio Conte's side fought back through Lukaku's strike after the break but the point meant they were unable to take advantage of a Juventus slip-up.The champions were held to a 1-1 draw at Lecce earlier in the day but they remain top of the table on 23 points, one point ahead of Inter in second.Bundesliga: Dortmund miss chance to cut leadSchalke 04 and Borussia Dortmund played out a lacklustre 0-0 draw on Saturday that saw both teams drop off the pace in the Bundesliga title race.Bundesliga tableBundesliga fixturesSchalke twice hit the woodwork through Salif Sane and Suat Serdar in a dominant first half with Dortmund content to play second fiddle.Dortmund left their attacking game for the second half with Jadon Sancho coming close, but they were badly missing injured top striker Paco Alcacer, out with a muscle problem.Third-placed Dortmund, who have now won only one of their last five league games, are on 16 points, with Schalke in seventh spot on 15.While avoiding defeat at Schalke is important in such a derby, the pressure on Dortmund coach Lucien Favre is mounting after their midweek Champions League loss to Inter Milan.Bayern Munich lead the standings on 18 points after edging visitors Union Berlin 2-1, with striker Robert Lewandowski becoming the first Bundesliga player to score in each of the first nine league games.Ligue 1: Lyon move away from dangerLyon finally looked like they may put their awful start to the league season behind them with a 2-0 win over relegation rivals Metz.Ligue 1 tableLigue 1 fixturesGoals from former Manchester United forward Memphis Depay and a penalty from ex-Celtic man Moussa Dembele proved the difference, with a result that moves Lyon up into 12th, two points ahead of their visitors, who they had trailed at the start of the day - and still sit 19th.

One of the most wanted men in football may not be the most familiar.  Sporting director Luis Campos has unearthed over &#163;500m worth of footballing talent during his time at Monaco and Lille, and in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports, gives a fascinating insight into his methods.Why Manchester United need a sporting directorHis CV is quite something, helping unearth Kylian Mbappe, Nicolas Pepe, James Rodriguez, Anthony Martial, Fabinho, Bernardo Silva and Benjamin Mendy.Transfer Centre LIVE!Paper TalkThe 55-year-old has been sporting director at Lille since 2017, helping them return to the Champions League after discovering some of Europe's best talents while at Monaco from 2013.Here, he talks through the key players he found, how he is determined to see players live - even for a few minutes - and whether he could be tempted out of Lille, having been linked with a number of European clubs over the summer, including Chelsea.Fabinho Liverpool's midfielder had a fine first season after arriving from Monaco in 2018, and Campos recalls how he came across the Brazilian by accident back in his youth career.\"I remember I go to the Copa Sao Paulo (Junior Football Competition) to see Fluminense who had a top team, some very good players. Now he&#700;s champion of Europe. It's amazing.\"I went to Brazil to watch Fluminese because they had some good players, they played Paulinia, the first team of Fabinho. Paulinia lost three or four-nil. I went there to see Fluminese players, but in the end I signed Fabinho. The talent is forever there, and sometimes you have an early opportunity.\"Bernardo Silva The Manchester City midfielder has been a revelation at the Etihad since arriving at Monaco, but Campos remembers his early days.\"I remember very well the first day of Bernardo in Monaco, he is small and people said: 'Who is this player?' He had been playing in the second division in Portugal, the Benfica B team.\"But he made an amazing season with us. Now he's a top player in England and one of the top players in the world.\"Anthony Martial The Manchester United forward, signed from Monaco in 2015, took only eight minutes to impress Campos while he was a youngster at Lyon.\"He had played only eight minutes for Lyon and they needed the money, so I told my CEO I need this boy. He said: 'Are you sure he could be a striker for us?' I said: 'We need to work with him but I believe he will become the best striker in France'. I bought him for 4m and sold him for 60.Kylian Mbappe  The PSG striker lit up the World Cup in 2018, and describes here how he helped get Mbappe back on track in 2013 before he was eventually sold for &#163;166m.\"The day I arrived in Monaco - Kylian wasn't happy at the club. I remember meeting his family and the family saying he is not staying, he's not playing, we don't understand. So I watched him play for 10 minutes and I thought, 'He is an amazing player, he needs to stay in the club&#700;.Premier League tableFind out more about Sky Sports\"So I put him in the B team and within two months he made a difference. So he soon needed to be in the first team. In my opinion he's the next best player in the world.Nicolas Pepe The Arsenal winger, signed from Lille in the summer, is a \"fan of football\", something Campos believes is vital.\"In my opinion one of the characteristics of a top, top player is that they like football. I remember working with Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe. They know everything about football. Mbappe knew all the results of the second division in France.\"Nicolas Pepe is like that. He&#700;s another example of the importance of a player liking football. After a game he watches the whole game again two times, to make himself more perfect.\"Victor Osimhen His latest find, 20-year-old Nigerian forward Osimhen, has scored seven in 10 games for Lille, including against Chelsea last week.\"I went to Lagos to see the U17 World Championships. After one match I wanted him. But his price was very expensive for a 17-year-old. I spoke to my CEO. I called him every night saying, 'Please give me this player, he is amazing. In two years he will be one of the best in Europe'.\"In the end the player went to Wolfsburg. I went to Wolfsburg just to see him play. Sometimes he only played for five minutes, sometimes only two. I was crazy for him! Then he had a virus and had five or six months not playing and went to Charleroi in Belgium. Two months later I signed him. So it&#700;s a nice story. I lost the player but then got him back.\"If all is normal at the end of the season there will be a big move for him because he's like a cat. You know, if you have a cat and give it a ball! He&#700;s unbelievable. In the last 20 metres he attacks every ball. Every ball. Like a cat.\" 'Only a special situation would tempt me'Having helped Lille return to the Champions League, Campos says the project with the French club is giving him enough pleasure at the moment. However, he would not rule out a move to another club if the situation was \"special\".\"Of course I want to work with a big club one day. But the Lille project gives me big pleasure because when I arrived we were in difficulty.\"Two years later we are in the Champions League and we made money too and we have very good young players too, so I believe in this project - I am happy here - so only a special situation will make me change a project.\"'Travelling to the moon' Campos explains how he travelled so much in one year, that an airline gave him a certificate for spending 20 days in the air, and travelling the equivalent of earth's distance to the moon.\"Last season was a particular season. We were at the start of the project and the club is not in an economically good situation. We needed to have a good team with five experienced players and three \"electrons\" - young, energetic, fast, strong players, and to find these players I had to travel a lot.\"The airline gave me a certificate. Twenty days in the air, 10 times around the world! I go to the moon in one year! I go to Africa and see street football and I see amazing players or I go to the Premier League.\"This difference is very important to me because I gain strength from the energy. So I travel the world because I want the top young players, not very expensive. I need to go there. For me the stats are important. The video is important but seeing live, the emotion the sense of the player, it makes the difference.\"That&#700;s why I travel a lot. In football you have to have the ball and you have to have the man to play the ball and you need to understand the man. You need to have this sensibility. For example, to understand the speed of maturation of a small boy or the speed of adaptation from another club or another country.\" The next step in scouting?Campos used his time at Real Madrid to develop a new piece of scouting software, Scouting System Pro, and was never afraid to offer an opinion.Now, he is developing a tool to help clubs form a picture of potential targets through analysis of their social media.\"At this moment I am developing software because it&#700;s very important. Sometimes we make mistakes, we take a guy with top technique or who is very strong and physical but they are not a good person. I believe, and the top university psychology department I am working with also believes, that it&#700;s possible to use social media as a photograph of the mentality of a player.\"When we finish this software we will surprise everyone. For example, if at the moment a player has a problem he sends an aggressive tweet very fast, this is an emotional player, a player who can&#700;t stay calm.\"If in his Instagram he is always at parties or on a boat or in a disco? So you take every social media post and more.\"Also, and this is a big surprise to me, the birth sign. This has influence too. I develop this just for me, but soon it will be for everyone, like my database Scouting System Pro.\"

Lamine Diaby-Fadiga has admitted he stole former Nice team-mate Kasper Dolberg's &#163;62,000 watch out of \"jealousy\".

A lot of them supported me and showed me kindness since I made my professional debut, as a youngster from the local region who joined the club when I was 14. Their reactions embody the level of disappointment that they feel towards me and I owe them some explanations.\"I proudly wore the club of my childhood's shirt last season in Ligue 1. I was unfortunately injured for several months and my return to competitive action was further delayed following a red card I picked up while playing for the U19s.\"\"That affected me mentally and my difficult situation contrasted starkly the success and aura of Kasper, my team-mate. I took it out on him without having any reason to do so, maybe a bit because of jealousy. Instead of trying to battle on the pitch to provide him with competition for places, I reacted stupidly towards him.\"My actions were not taken out of an appetite to gain something from it, but out of spite, frustration and feeling discredited. Of course, I am only 18, but my age excuses nothing. I therefore owned up to what I had done to Kasper, Mr Fournier, the director general of the club, Patrick Vieira, my coach and Dante, my captain. One by one, I apologised to each one of them. \"I also took on the responsibility of reimbursing my team-mate fully, which I have now done. I wish him a lot of success at OGC Nice and in his career. Maybe one day we will come across each other on a pitch and this affair will be merely a bad memory.\"Now, I am leaving the club where I had always wanted to succeed and enjoy myself, which for me is the greatest possible punishment. I thank all those who believed in me. I hope to be able to prove one day that they were right and that I am worth more than what has happened. Redemption for me will come on the football pitch and I now want to concentrate on my passion, football.\"Despite the incident, Diaby-Fadiga has been linked with a potential move to Ligue 2 team Paris FC, who recently added free agent Jeremy Menez to their team.Nice, who are managed by former Arsenal and France midfielder Patrick Vieira, were taken over by British businessman Jim Ratcliffe in August.

The Brazil international visited Barcelona where he is suing the Spanish champions over an unpaid loyalty bonus of &#8364;26m (&#163;23m) but ultimately chose not to appear in court,Neymar's presence was not compulsory and only likely in case of a trial, so his absence was initially seen as a sign a last-minute agreement deal could be reached.

Neymar is back and delivering on the pitch, but he still has his work cut out to get Paris Saint-Germain supporters back onside following his failed summer move to Barcelona. PSG, who face Reims in Ligue 1 at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday evening, operated under a cloud throughout the summer with the future of one of their marquee players shrouded in uncertainty.The Brazilian missed the Ligue 1 champions' first five games as he pushed for a return to Barcelona, but the deal fell through after protracted talks.Neymar has since made a match-winning return against Strasbourg, scoring a breathtaking overhead kick in the 92nd minute, but it was not enough to turn the torrent of ill-feeling towards the forward from the PSG supporters.Thomas Tuchel: Neymar committed to PSGNeymar agrees PSG stay as Barca talks break downThe 27-year-old scored yet another winner last Sunday as Thomas Tuchel's side secured a 1-0 victory at Lyon, but he was again the target of abuse as the home fans threw objects at him during the clash at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais \"It is not the first time I have been booed by everyone,\" Neymar told reporters after PSG's win against Strasbourg. \"It is sad but I know that, from now on, every game I play will be an away game.\"\"I made it clear I have nothing against the fans, nothing against Paris Saint-Germain as a club,\" he added. \"Everyone knows I wanted to leave. I am not going to get into the details of what happened.\"It is time to turn the page. Today I am a PSG player and I am going to give everything on the field.\" Brazilian ESPN journalist Natalie Gedra believes her compatriot must get used to the fact there will be animosity towards him wherever he plays in France.Speaking on the Sunday Supplement, Gedra said: \"After the match against Strasbourg he gave his first interview in a very long time and he said he did want to leave PSG because of personal reasons. It was nothing against the club, he just wanted to go back to Barcelona for personal reasons.\"He knows this season he will always be playing away, even when he is playing at the Parc des Princes. It's okay that most fans don't like him at this very moment because the most important thing is for the fans to be behind the team, and not behind Neymar. 'Neymar must put up with PSG fans'Paris Saint-Germain fixtures\"The reception he got during the game against Strasbourg was a demonstration from the ultras on how unsatisfied they are with Neymar. I think during the season there is a chance that he wins some of the \"regular\" fans at PSG back, but not the ultras. The ultras have really made up their mind on Neymar and the way that he behaved did not help. \"His clear preference for leaving PSG, making a real effort to do so, giving an interview saying his highlight as a player was the Barcelona locker room when they beat PSG - fans don't forget these things easily.\"With the way he behaved I was curious to see how his first match for PSG would go and it went as I imagined because he always delivers on the pitch. Nobody questions his talent or anything like that.\"He always does well for Brazil. During the Copa America Brazilian fans were really missing him and they were saying how reliant the Brazil team is on him. Nobody questions that. It's just the way he behaves, is it as professional as it should be?\"Kaka: Neymar can lead PSG CL challengeChampions League: PSG sweep aside lacklustre Real Madrid A career of ups and downs Gedra interviewed a 14-year-old Neymar for the first time at Santos, and added: \"There have been a lot of ups and downs during his career because he reached a peak at Santos and then at a certain point of his career in Brazil he had some attitude issues with an old manager that were discussed.\"Then he went to Barcelona and things just settled for him. His football improved, his physicality improved, and he had much more of a low profile. In the national team it's always been the same. He really likes to play for the national team. \"Everybody praises him and the way that he behaves in the national team, but in his club career there have been a lot of ups and downs.\"He says that if you look at his stats from last season he did well. Of course, we can look at his statistics but when you reach a level you expect so much more than just goals and assists from him.\"He can deliver at that level. We're not just talking about his football but him as a professional footballer.\"Ligue 1 fixtures | Ligue 1 tableFind out more about Sky Sports 'Mbappe will always be favoured over Neymar'The French club paid a world-record &#8364;222m (&#163;200m) for him in August 2017 and publicly stated that he could leave \"if an offer suits\". But having set a high valuation and refused to lower their asking price, the player's personal pleas fell on deaf ears.After Neymar even offered to pay &#163;17.7m (&#8364;20m) towards securing a deal, the Daily Telegraph's Chief Football Correspondent Jason Burt believes PSG will seek to build their team around Kylian Mbappe.\"He will be the main man at Paris Saint-Germain,\" Burt said. \"If you asked PSG who they'd rather lose they'd rather lose Neymar, but they are not going to lose him without the fee being paid back.\"The Qatari owners are very proud people. They are not going to let this player go just because he wants to go. What's going to be fascinating this season is how much pressure they put on him because they feel he's massively under-performed and not tried at times.\"They've challenged him on that now and they'll want to see how he reacts to that. They will do all they can to keep Mbappe ahead of Neymar.\"

The Catalan club and Real Madrid were both interested in bringing the forward back to Spain this summer, but prior to the European transfer deadline, Neymar instead agreed to stay at the Parc des Princes.The 27-year-old, who remains the world's most expensive footballer after his &#163;200m (&#8364;222) move in 2017, is under contract at PSG until 2022.Neymar: What happened?\"In view of the market, Neymar will retire at PSG unless he lowers his salary and also his PSG claims,\" Tebas said.\"The problem of not coming back now [to Barcelona] has to do with his own departure to PSG.\"It was an off-market transfer, it was only possible to happen with 'traps' to increase sponsorships.\"When you do it out of the market, it is impossible to sell again at this price.\" 'Neymar faces fight to win over PSG fans'Navas joins PSG, Areola loaned to RealDespite not playing a game for PSG this season, Brazil boss Tite has confirmed the forward is in contention for selection ahead of his side's friendly against Colombia on Friday evening.Neymar suffered an ankle injury in Brazil's 2-0 friendly victory over Qatar earlier this year, which was the last time he played in a competitive fixture.

It does (worry me not having Neymar playing games) and I hope that it is solved.\"But it's a variable that escapes me, it is beyond me. \"I can't solve this situation. I have hope, the only thing I can do is to hope. Beyond that, I don't have any power.\"The forward has also missed his club side's opening four Ligue 1 games of their 2019/20 campaign, despite being involved in training at the start of the season.Regarding his availability for his national side, Tite said: \"He's ready. He was not playing before for many reasons but here he is ready, in conditions to do whatever the national squad needs him to do.\"We can adjust and not miss such a player like him. \"Neymar is indispensable, he's irreplaceable and I will give you numbers to confirm that. Fifty per cent of the goals scored when he's playing are either from him or he assists.\"The conclusion is that the team needs his individual skills, needs the great athlete, and the great athlete needs the squad.\"Brazil are unbeaten in 18 matches since being knocked out of the 2018 World Cup by Belgium at the quarter-final stage.Tite's side beat Peru 3-1 in the Copa America final in July, while Colombia reached the last eight.
